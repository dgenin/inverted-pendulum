This is a baremetal implementation of inverted pendulum driver for Raspberry Pi A+. The inverted pendulum base is constructed on Epson Deskjet 960c carriage mechanism and utilizes the original optical encoder strip and the motor and belt mechanism.

The code for UART and interrupt handling is borrowed from David Welches excellent Raspberry Pi example repository https://github.com/dwelch67/stm32f0d. Thank you David!
